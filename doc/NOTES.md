Ruby documentation overwhelming

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10925478/how-to-read-api-documentation-for-newbs

is there some mysterious document somewhere that tells people how to read API documentation?

Why is it written like that? What prior knowledge does it assume I have? Why is it like this, and what can I do to stop wondering about it and "get" it, so I can more happily read and implement the next API?

So why is API documentation written in such a way as to confuse perennial newbs / hackers / DIYers like myself?

I find meetups intimidating
