# Welcome to Bangkok

Twenty one hours of air travel later we land in Bangkok. It's 11 pm local time.
We are tired, hungry, dirty, and a bit grumpy. But we're excited to be at our destination--half-way around the world.

Luckily we thought ahead a little bit and booked a hotel within a ten minute drive.
We showered, ate some leftover plane-snacks, and passed out cold.

The next morning we pack up our bags and head out to find some breakfast. I found the Phoenix hotel nearby that advertised breakfast for 100 baht (~$4). Turns out you had to be a guest there to get that rate and we are charged 150 baht each. This is when we start realizing that Thailand isn't as inexpensive as we expected.
To really start our adventure we needed to get downtown to our next hotel. We ended up wandering through a sub-division trying to find a skytrain stop but after some odd stares from the locals we backed away slowly and hailed a cab back to the airport. From there we caught the skytrain into the heart of downtown Bangkok.
